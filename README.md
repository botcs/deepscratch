# **Deep Vision** - *A lib from scratch*
## (or from scipy by the way)

## Main purposes:
It became easier to understand (for me, of course) the following models:
- [x] [MLP](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/),
- [x] [ConvNet](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/),
- [x] [DeConvNet](http://www.matthewzeiler.com/pubs/cvpr2010/cvpr2010.pdf),
- [ ] [RBM](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rbm.html),
- [ ] [RNN](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

## When I started to implement
these models myself, everything became brighter, more intuitive, sometimes obvius - compared to the mathematical formulas representing a clear idea

## Currently my primary goal
Is to make some sense of what are those neurons are 'thinking', inside a large net, hoping, that someday I will be able to retrain useful information from living organisms' inner state based on my current study

Generally speaking, *understanding* could be called some kind of visualisation...
